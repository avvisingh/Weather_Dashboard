### Description

This app accepts a user's input which contains the name of a location for which the user would like the weather forecast of and, in turn, the app displays the forecast for the date of search and for the next 5 days. This app uses 2 separate APIs - namely the MapBox API and the OpenWeather API. The user's text input is passed to the MapBox which converts that to a set of latitude and longitude coordinates and, in turn, passes them to the OpenWeather to request the weather forecast for the specified location. The app also stored the users Search History in the browser's localStorage should the user wish to access that.
